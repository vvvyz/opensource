In elixr there are two scope:

- the global scope
- function clause scope

there are a number of constructs than create new scope

- defmodule„ÄÅdef
- functions: fn, def, defp
- for statement, is liking the JavaScript
- try block body bodies

I wrote some examples in the file of `scope.ex`
